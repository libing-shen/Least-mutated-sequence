This directory holds the supplemental files for the manuscript entitled "Exploring the Origin of the COVID-19 Pandemic Using a Non-parametric Approach".

The file "249137_strains_mutation_count.txt" is the mutation-counting result of 249137 strains.

The file "jackknife_test_with_strain-1.tar.gz" is the 5000 jackknife-test results with strain-1.

The file "jackknife_test_without_strain-1.tar.gz" is the 5000 jackknife-test results without strain-1.

The file "mutation_profile_for_all_strains_with_template_strain-1.txt.gz" is the mutation profile of 249137 strains compared with strain-1.

The file "mutation_profile_for_all_strains_with_template_strain-7329.txt.gz" is the mutation profile of 249137 strains compared with strain-7329.

The file "sorted_249137_strains_by_collection_date.txt.gz" is the sorted strains according to their numbers of mutations from the least to the largest. It also contains the information of collection date and location for each viral sequence.

The file "strain_mutation_positions_dif_less_than_200.txt.gz" is the mutation position matrix for 249137 strains.

The strain sequence files are uploaded to github as well. They are "strain_coding_sequence_part_1.fa.gz", "strain_coding_sequence_part_2.fa.gz", "strain_coding_sequence_part_3.fa.gz", and "strain_coding_sequence_part_4.fa.gz", which can be integrated into one big strain sequence file.
