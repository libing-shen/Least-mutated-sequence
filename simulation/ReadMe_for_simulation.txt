This directory holds the simulation results for the manuscript entitled "A Method for Calculating the Least Mutated Sequence in DNA Alignment Based on Point Mutation Sites".

The file "ancestral_sequence.fa" is the ancestral sequence for generating mutation sequences.

The file "natural_mutation_process.rar" is the simulation results of natural mutation process.

The file "random_mutation_generator.pl" is the Perl program for generating mutation sequences.

The file "reverse_and_saturation_mutation.rar" is the simulation results of reverse and saturation mutation process.

Note: The files "natural_mutation_process.rar" and "reverse_and_saturation_mutation.rar" only contain a small part of simulation results. The complete simulation results are too large to be uploaded on github. They are available on request.
